# 👋 Hello!

I am a Software Developer with over 4 years of work experience building high-quality, efficient, and user-friendly programs that exceed expectations. I focus on delivering exceptional results and have a proven track record of success.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work at [Sword Health](https://swordhealth.com/) through outsourcing by [Bee Engineering](https://www.bee-eng.pt/en), where I contribute to developing innovative digital health solutions. I've been building and maintaining APIs and microservices to support our mobile app for patients (available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swordhealth.guarda) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sword-health/id1468523447)) and our web platform for doctors.

🤝 I thrive on challenges and seek out exciting projects that push my skills to the limit. Every project allows me to learn and grow as a developer.
