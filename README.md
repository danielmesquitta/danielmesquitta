# 👋 Hello!

I am a Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of work experience dedicated to helping companies build high-quality, user-friendly web and mobile applications that exceed their business objectives. I focus on delivering exceptional results and have a proven track record of success.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am using my skills to develop innovative solutions and bring ideas to life at [Flow Lab](https://www.instagram.com/flowlabdigital).

🤝 I thrive on challenges and seek out exciting projects that push my skills to the limit. Every project is an opportunity for me to learn and grow as a developer.

🌱 I am continuously improving my skills and knowledge base. At the moment, I am focused on honing my GraphQL expertise, and expanding my understanding of serverless architectures.

💪 In my free time, I am an avid weightlifter. This passion for fitness helps me maintain focus and balance in both my personal and professional life.
